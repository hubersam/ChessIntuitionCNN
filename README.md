# ChessIntuitionCNN

The purpose of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network that can not only predict the outcome of KPvK chess endgames, but also give a heatmap visualization using Gradient-weighed Class Activation Mapping.

The Syzygy tablebase can be downloaded from [https://tablebase.lichess.ovh/tables/standard/](https://tablebase.lichess.ovh/tables/standard/).

The `FINAL_SAVE.db` is about 2GB in size, so it could not be uploaded. However, parts of the code are dedicated to generating the training data itself.
